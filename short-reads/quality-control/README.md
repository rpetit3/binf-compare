# Short Read Quality Control

## Goal of Comparisons

## Tools Compared

* __illumina-cleanup (vXXX)__  
A Nextflow powered pipeline for pre-processing Illumina sequence reads.

* __Shovill (vXXX)__  
Although Shovill is meant for short read assembly, it includes pre-proccessing steps.

* __Trimmomatic (vXXX)__  
A flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data.

## Disclaimer
These comparisons are not meant to be all encompassing (testing all preprocessors and all tools). Although these comparisons may be applicable to all Illumina sequences, these comparisons were meant for bacterial sequences. The parameters tested were what I use in my own analyses.
